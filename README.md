# SMART PARKING SYSTEM
The Smart Parking System is designed using an ESP32 microcontroller, RFID technology, and IR sensors. It facilitates automated parking management by detecting vehicle presence with IR sensors and authenticating users via RFID tags. The system is programmed using the Arduino IDE for efficient and real-time parking space monitoring.
